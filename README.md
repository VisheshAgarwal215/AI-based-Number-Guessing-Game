# **Guessing the Number Game**

## **Project Description**

**Guessing the Number Game** is a simple Python console game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a defined range. The player is allowed five attempts to guess the correct number. After each guess, the game provides feedback, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low. The game ends either when the player guesses the number correctly or when the player runs out of attempts.

This project is designed to help beginners learn and practice basic Python programming concepts like loops, conditionals, random number generation, and exception handling.
